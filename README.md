# The Challenge Set:

* As a user, I can play against another human player.


## XO â€” The Rules?

### Player X goes first

The player that is assigned the X counter will make the first move on the grid. They can place their 'X' wherever they choose.

### Player O goes second

Next the Player O will move on the grid. They cannot overwrite a X counter.

### The Aim

The first player to have 3 counters in a row, column or diagonal wins the game.


## How to Install and Use the Code (and also run the tests)

1. To install, first clone this repository.
2. Open the file `index.html` from the project root in the browser. You'll see the webpage loaded - you can then assign your name to either 'X' or 'O' and start adding counters to the grid.

3. If you would like to clear the grid and start again, click `New Game`.
4. To run the tests - open the file `SpecRunner.html`(you'll see all tests passing in Jasmine), then inspect - and access the console.

### Optional Extras I am still working on!

* Computer vs Computer mode
* Computer player is unbeatable
* Backend service
* Option of who goes first
* Set up [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) to run your tests.
* Add [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) to your codebase and make your code conform.
